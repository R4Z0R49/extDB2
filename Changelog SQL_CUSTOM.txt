SQL_CUSTOM Major Changes
This just lists info on changes when SQL_CUSTOM version is bumped.
Looking for more info on SQL_CUSTOM check out https://github.com/Torndeco/extDB2/wiki/Calls:-Protocol--SQL_CUSTOM

Versions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11->12
	Added: SQL_CUSTOM + SQL_CUSTOM_V2   Seperator Character (Base10)   Option
		Allows you define the seperator character for entire SQL_CUSTOM Protocol or callnames
			Value for Option is in Base10  i.e  58 = :

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10->11
	Added: Player_Key
		Example of use
		9:START_RCON:PLAYERKEY

			[getPlayerBankMoney]
			SQL1_1 = SELECT BankMoney FROM PlayerInfo WHERE UID = ?;

			Number of Inputs = 1
			SQL1_INPUTS = 1-PlayerKey
			Return Player Key = true

		Example of returned result = [1,["QWIOEJQWSAD",[2000]]]

		Ok time to explain what PlayerKey is....

		To start with it requires extDB2 to be connected to server via Rcon and using the option PLAYERKEY.
		When a player connects to Rcon they are automatically given a unique randomized PlayerKey.
		When the player disconnects the PlayerKey is removed (read note below)

		By saying 1-PlayerKey we are telling SQL_CUSTOM to use Input Value 1 + return the unique player key for that player.
		The input value can either be PlayerUID or BEGuid, makes no difference.
		You can also use InsertID at the same time, the format for that is [1,[<InsertID>,[<PlayerKey>,<Result>]]]

		If there is an error, for example extDB2 isn't connected to the server via Rcon.
		The returned PlayerKey is an empty string.


		Why ?
		This will allow you to offload randomized player value to the extension.
		But the main reason it will be integerated feature to extDB2 upcoming BELogscanner.
		You will be able to make regex rules to ban/kick players for entries in BattlEye that don't have the correct playerkey.
		It will be possible to enable adding/removing playerkeys manually, but it will require extra callExtensions + will be less secure.

		The BELogscanner feature is heavily based of my old pyBEscanner, if anyone remembers it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9->10
	Added: String_Escape_Quotes
		Escapes " -> ""  ,   ' -> ''
		Added " to either end of string
		Example  aaa'bbb"dsadsd"  -> "aaa''bbb""dsadsd"""   so it will call compile correctly
		Useful for when storing + retreiving playernames from Database

	Added: Check_Add_Quotes (Input Only Option)
		This just adds "<value>" before running a sanitize check.
		Useful for when storing a string in database + you like to a check it, but you don't wont to store quotes wrapping the string.

	Added: Check_Add_Escape_Quotes (Input Only Option)
		This will escape the quotations (just like String_Escape_Quotes) before running a sanitize check.
		Useful for when storing strings in raw form and are retrieving via String_Escape_Quotes later on. e.g playernames

	Added: DateTime_ISO8601 (Output Only Option)
		Used to convert ISO8601 Format i.e "2015-05-13T20:16:24Z" to arma array [Year,Month,Day,Hour,Minute,Second] or [] for Null Entry


	Removed Vac_BeGUID  Why the hell did i think you could query Steam Servers with BEGuid


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8->9
	Change "Strip Custom Input Chars" -> "Strip Custom Chars"
		Not a Typo, only afew people will have "Strip Custom Input Chars", most should already be using "Strip Custom Chars".
